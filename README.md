# Space Clones

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/72a42bba-457b-4064-a6f8-fa699dd8e6df/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/space-clones/deploys)

Original web browser game built with JavaScript and jQuery, inspired by the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. Control a ship as you fight a brigade of alien clones hellbent on destroying Earth.

This project holds a special place in my heart, because it's my first real code project that originated in my Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.
