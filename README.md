# space_invaders_game

Browser game inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders. Original name to be determined.

USER STORY:

This will be a two player game, so first the user will be presented with a title screen displaying a high score at the top, with the option to play in a 1 player mode or 2 player mode. The 2 player mode will have the two players taking turns.

The player will control their ship using the left and right arrows or AD for directions, and either clicking or hitting spacebar to fire their laser. The player will be locked in a horizontal plane at the bottom of the game screen.

The player will begin the game with 3 lives. One hit will result in player death. Once all lives are depleted, the game will be over, and a final score screen will be presented with a newly introduced fire accuracy stat as well.

BASIC WIREFRAME:

Like in Space Invaders, each level will feature an array of descending enemy ships which will move left to right as they descend. Each enemy will disintegrate with one hit. Once all enemies are defeated, a mothership will appear that takes more hits to defeat.

As the player progresses, each level will increase the speed of the enemy ships and the lasers they fire, increasing the difficulty of the game.

Each defeated enemy ship will increment the player's score by a set value, with the mothership incrementing it by an increased amount.

EXTRA POSSIBILITIES:

Create bonus stages which allow the players to gain extra points, but player will not be able to die during these.

Allow player to upgrade shields/weapons.

Allow player to gain extra lives at certain score intervals.

Allow player to customize the color of their ship.

Allow player to name their character.

Display a sprite out of the game field that represents the character's avatar as they're playing.

Introduce a prologue to set up a context for the game. Star Wars opening credit style text.

Add a game demo if player leaves start menu open after a set interval of time.

Allow player to hold certain items and use them to their advantage at their discretion.

At higher levels, introduce meteors/comets/other space anomalies that will pose a threat to the player in addition to the enemy ships.

Create a final boss character that will result in a win for the player once defeated. The conflict between the final boss and the player is what drives the basic "plot" of the game.
